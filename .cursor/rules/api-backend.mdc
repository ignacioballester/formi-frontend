Use the autogenerated API Client of core, iam, runner and secret-manager to get information from the backend. The code documentation on how to use the clients are stored in ./lib/generated-api/core/docs, ./lib/generated-api/iam/docs, ./lib/generated-api/runner/docs and ./lib/generated-api/secret-manager/docs. Write the logic for the components in actions inside ./app/actions. Do not use ./api folder and do not create next.js api routes.
